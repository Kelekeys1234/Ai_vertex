    		+ "What it does: This upskilling is directly driven by fundamental, transformative changes in an organization's core business model or strategic direction. As a company undergoes a major strategic shift (e.g., from traditional retail to a digital-first e-commerce operation), employees need to acquire entirely new and often complex skill sets relevant to the new strategy. This ensures they can contribute effectively to the company's success in its new operational mode and adapt to a significantly altered business landscape.\r\n"
